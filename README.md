# rpi-gpib-pcb
PCB for a Raspberry Pi GPIB board.

Different PCB layout for a electronomikon's Raspberry Pi GPIB shield design at https://github.com/elektronomikon/raspi_gpib_shield/.

This board is 100x100mm and connects to the RPI with 2x20 ribbon cable. Designed to fit into particular milled aluminum box I had lying around. RPI has VXI11 server which exposes GPIB to the network.
